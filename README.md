- `php artisan config:cache` with this command It combines these configuration settings into a single array and serializes this array into a file.
- `The php artisan migrate` command in Laravel is a powerful tool that allows you to manage your database schema through migrations.
- `php artisan make:model ModelName` to create model.
- `php artisan make:model User -m` i create user with this command and delete before the database all migration file and user file from the Models file.
